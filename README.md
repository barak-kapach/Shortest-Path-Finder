Shortest-Path-Finder

Shortest-Path-Finder is a Python-based tool designed to calculate the most efficient path between nodes in a graph, taking into account factors such as slope and distance.

Features
	•	Customizable Weight Functions: Incorporates various weight functions to adjust path calculations based on slope and distance.
	•	Slope-Based Pathfinding: Selects appropriate weight functions according to slope values to determine optimal paths.

Installation
	1.	Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Shortest-Path-Finder.git
cd Shortest-Path-Finder


	2.	Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended):

python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate


	3.	Install Dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt



Usage
	1.	Import the Desired Weight Function:

from weightFuncFactory import combined_weight_and_distance


	2.	Calculate the Weight:

slope = 0.05  # Example slope value
factor = 2    # Example factor
distance = 100  # Distance between nodes

weight = combined_weight_and_distance(slope, factor, distance)


	3.	Integrate into Your Pathfinding Algorithm:
Incorporate the weight function into your graph traversal algorithm to compute the optimal path based on slope and distance.
